       "5             I love tracy reese dresses, but this one is not for the very petite. i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand. this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress. the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame. not a stranger to alterations, shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment. i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me. i returned this dress.   \n",
       "6     I aded this in my basket at hte last mintue to see what it would look like in person. (store pick up). i went with teh darkler color only because i am so pale :-) hte color is really gorgeous, and turns out it mathced everythiing i was trying on with it prefectly. it is a little baggy on me and hte xs is hte msallet size (bummer, no petite). i decided to jkeep it though, because as i said, it matvehd everything. my ejans, pants, and the 3 skirts i waas trying on (of which i ]kept all ) oops.   \n",
       "7                   I ordered this in carbon for store pick up, and had a ton of stuff (as always) to try on and used this top to pair (skirts and pants). everything went with it. the color is really nice charcoal with shimmer, and went well with pencil skirts, flare pants, etc. my only compaint is it is a bit big, sleeves are long and it doesn't go in petite. also a bit loose for me, but no xxs... so i kept it and wil ldecide later since the light color is already sold out in hte smallest size...   \n",

       "43  First, this is thermal ,so naturally i didn't expect super sheer, but it is. really sheer light fabric. i like it, but be prepared for considering who you might run into if you walk around the house in it. second, it is large. i ordered the size 0 and it's a nice oversized fit for my 5'3\" 125 pounds. i wouldn't want to go larger. along with being sheer, the fabric is easily stretched, which i don't mind in this case. finally, the color. it looks white on my monitor and shows a colorful blue dot   \n",

    "After testing out logistic regression and multinomial NB models with both count vectorizer and tfidf as well as using the NLTK package polarity method, on the toy dataset only including 1 and 5-star reviews, the logistic regression using count vectorizer scored the best in accuracy, precision, and recall. Therefore, I decided to use the combination of count vectorizer and logistic regression on the full dataset, involving hypertuning the parameters with a grid search algorithm.In order for the model to predict more than two classes, I had to set multi_class to multinomial. Furthermore, the solver had to be changed. I changed the solver to newton-cg, which handles L2 regularization at no penalty. Since the data contains a lot more positive reviews than negative reviews, the false negative rate was a lot higher. Therefore to improve the model, the focus should be on recall and include a larger set of training values with scores of 0 or 1. The model had a final accuracy score of .83, which is 5 percent higher than the null accuracy."

       "14594  I agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that didn't require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness. i mean for the price shouldn't it be lined or something. when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low. but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i can't really complain too much. plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off. i gave up at that\n",
